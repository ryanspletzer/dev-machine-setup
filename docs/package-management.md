# Package Management Strategy

This document explains the comprehensive package management strategy used across all platforms in the dev-machine-setup project, including the rationale behind package manager selection and best practices.

## Philosophy

The package management strategy is built on the principle of
**"Leverage native and community package managers for reliable installations"** -
leveraging the most appropriate and well-supported package managers for each platform
while maintaining consistency in the user experience.

## Package Manager Selection Criteria

When selecting package managers for each platform, we evaluate:

1. **Native Integration**: How well the package manager integrates with the OS
2. **Package Availability**: Breadth and quality of available packages
3. **Community Support**: Size and activity of the maintainer community
4. **Security Model**: Package verification and trust mechanisms
5. **Dependency Management**: Automatic resolution and conflict handling
6. **Update Mechanisms**: How packages are kept current

## Platform-Specific Package Management

### macOS Package Management

#### Primary Package Managers

**Homebrew** serves as the primary package manager for macOS:

- **Homebrew Formulae**: Command-line tools and libraries
- **Homebrew Casks**: GUI applications and large binaries
- **Homebrew Taps**: Third-party package repositories

```yaml
# CLI tools via Homebrew formulae
homebrew_formulae:
  - git              # Version control system
  - docker           # Container runtime
  - terraform        # Infrastructure as code
  - kubectl          # Kubernetes CLI

# GUI applications via Homebrew casks
homebrew_casks:
  - visual-studio-code    # Code editor
  - docker-desktop        # Container GUI
  - google-chrome         # Web browser
  - slack                 # Communication tool
```

#### Specialized Package Managers

Additional package managers handle specific ecosystems:

- **pipx**: Python applications and CLI tools
- **npm**: Node.js packages and tools
- **PowerShell Gallery**: PowerShell modules
- **.NET CLI**: .NET global tools
- **VS Code Marketplace**: Editor extensions

**Why this approach works:**

- Homebrew provides excellent macOS integration
- Formulae and casks cover most development needs
- Specialized managers handle language-specific tools
- All managers support dependency resolution

### Windows Package Management

#### Primary Package Manager

**Chocolatey** serves as the unified package manager for Windows:

```yaml
choco_packages:
  - name: git
  - name: vscode
  - name: docker-desktop
  - name: terraform
  - name: kubernetes-cli
```

#### Specialized Package Managers

- **PowerShell Gallery**: PowerShell modules (built-in to Windows)
- **npm**: Node.js packages (installed via Chocolatey)
- **pipx**: Python tools (installed via Chocolatey)
- **VS Code Marketplace**: Editor extensions

**Why Chocolatey:**

- Largest Windows package repository
- Strong community maintenance
- Good dependency management
- PowerShell integration
- Supports both CLI and GUI applications

#### Alternative Considerations

We evaluated but chose not to use:

- **winget**: Microsoft's official package manager (newer, smaller repository)
- **scoop**: Popular but more limited package selection
- **Ninite**: Web-based, not scriptable

### Ubuntu Package Management

#### Primary Package Managers

Ubuntu uses a dual approach with complementary package managers:

**APT (Advanced Package Tool)**:

- System packages and libraries
- Command-line tools
- Development dependencies

```yaml
apt_packages:
  - git
  - docker.io
  - build-essential
  - curl
  - wget
```

**Snap Packages**:

- GUI applications
- Self-contained applications
- Cross-distribution packages

```yaml
snap_packages:
  - code --classic
  - discord
  - slack --classic
```

#### Specialized Package Managers

- **pipx**: Python applications
- **PowerShell Gallery**: PowerShell modules (after PowerShell installation)
- **VS Code Marketplace**: Editor extensions

**Why the dual approach:**

- APT provides system integration and dependencies
- Snap provides modern applications with automatic updates
- Covers the broadest range of software needs

## Package Categories and Organization

| **Cloud Tools** | Cloud platform integration | awscli, azure-cli, gcloud |
| **Infrastructure** | DevOps and deployment | terraform, ansible, helm |

### Cross-Platform Package Mapping

Where possible, we use equivalent packages across platforms:

| Tool | macOS | Windows | Ubuntu |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| Git | `git` (brew) | `git` (choco) | `git` (apt) |
| VS Code | `visual-studio-code` (cask) | `vscode` (choco) | `code` (snap) |
| Docker | `docker-desktop` (cask) | `docker-desktop` (choco) | `docker.io` (apt) |
| Node.js | `node` (brew) | `nodejs` (choco) | `nodejs` (apt) |
| Python | `python` (brew) | `python` (choco) | `python3` (apt) |

## Package List Management

### Configuration Structure

Each platform maintains package lists in YAML format:

```yaml
# Platform-specific package manager sections
homebrew_formulae: []    # macOS CLI tools
homebrew_casks: []       # macOS GUI applications
choco_packages: []       # Windows packages
apt_packages: []         # Ubuntu system packages
snap_packages: []        # Ubuntu applications

# Cross-platform sections (consistent naming)
vscode_extensions: []    # VS Code extensions
