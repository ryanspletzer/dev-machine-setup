## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

All platforms support extensive customization through their respective configuration files:

- **macOS**: Edit `macOS/vars.yaml` to customize the Ansible playbook
- **Windows**: Edit `windows/vars.yaml` to customize the PowerShell script
- **Ubuntu**: Edit `ubuntu/vars.yaml` to customize the Ansible playbook

You can add or remove packages, change system preferences, and even add custom scripts to run at the end of the setup
process. For detailed customization instructions, see the [Customization Guide](./docs/customization.md).
